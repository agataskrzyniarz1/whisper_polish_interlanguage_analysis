We are at the railway station. I am a tourist from Warsaw, and you live in Kraków. How do you go from the railway station to Dobra 4 Street?
Please go to Niska Street, turn right to Juliuska-Słowackiego Street, turn left to Dobra Street, and you will find the Kowalski House.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
